# 🎨 Dynamic CSS Styling Tool

## 🌟 Overview
This project is an interactive web application that allows users to dynamically style an image using CSS properties such as spacing, blur, and color. With a simple and intuitive user interface, users can change the spacing between the image and its container, apply a blur filter, and select both the base and background colors, all in real-time.



## 📋 Features

- Responsive design that works across various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Real-time updates for image styling as users interact with the controls.
- Interactive sliders for adjusting blur and spacing.
- Color pickers for setting base and background colors dynamically.
- Smooth transitions for hover effects on both the image and the control panel.
